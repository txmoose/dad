Dad went into cardiac arrest in the middle of the night. Caleb was, thankfully, around to start aid, and he worked with the paramedics to provide CPR and get dad into an ambulance.

He was taken to Baptist Hospital, and admitted to the ER, then eventually ICU, and put on a ventilator. Diagnosis at the time was Covid and pneumonia.

Katelyn and I packed up the truck and the dogs, and we drove 11 and a half hours, arriving in Beaumont in the early hours of Monday morning. ICU visiting hours at Baptist are 9 to 9, though, so we didn't get to see dad until Monday.
