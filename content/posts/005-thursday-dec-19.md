They extubated dad on Thursday, and things started moving what felt quickly. His fever was down and he was more or less off sedation fully at this point. He was still weak, and it was even more difficult to understand him, but that can be attributed to a myraid of factors.

Around 9 in the evening, they moved dad from ICU to "tele", which is a step down unit from ICU. Because he was covid positive on intake, he was put into an isolation room. The good news here is that visitors can be there 24 hours a day. Given that mom had been at the hospital nearly all day every day since, and Emily and Caleb were feeling sick, I stayed with dad this first night out of ICU.

I didn't get much sleep, but dad did get some. He's still got a sense of humor through all this, but his processing seems blunted.
