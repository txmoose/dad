The night before was a long night. I didn't sleep much, and the chair in the room wasn't the most comfortable, but it certainly could have been far worse. Dad slept a lot of the night, but woke up a number of times when staff had to do things like take vitals or give him a breathing treatment.

The outpouring of support from mom's church family and friends was nearly overwhelming. The meals, well wishes, kind words, and friendly faces really has been a blessing through all this.

Friday seemed so long. I made it home around 9am or so, and caught a nap after spending some time with Katelyn, but made it back up to the hospital in the afternoon. Katelyn and I were going to spend Friday night with dad, but Katelyn talked me into heading home around 10pm or so.
