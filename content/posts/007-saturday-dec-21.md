I got back to the hospital around 7am to relieve Katelyn and bring her breakfast. Dad slept through the night, but spent much of Saturday napping and watching football. He's got a sense of humor still, even if it takes him longer to grasp what was said.

We expected to hear from case management/social work on Friday, but they didn't come around until today. He's got options around skilled nursing facilities, so we'll need to make a decision very soon. 

His fever is all but gone, and it seems like his vitals are stable day to day. We think the hospital is going to want to discharge him sooner rather than later, possibly as soon as Monday. We're not sure if we'll have found a facility by then, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
