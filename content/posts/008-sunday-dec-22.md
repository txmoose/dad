The discussion today is around what happens next. He's probably going to be discharged from the hospital sooner rather than later, and we will need to find a skilled nursing facility for him. It absolutely kills me that this is what happens next, but it is the best thing. He requires 24/7 care at this point, and that just isn't something we can provide at home.
