We visited some Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF, or "Sniff", apparently) today. We're pretty sure dad will be discharged from the hospital this week, so we need to have a decision made on where he'll go after this. Of the ones we visited, we think we have a decision. The facility is nice and well taken care of, and the staff all seemed knowledgeable and genuine. We also got some more understanding of how the finances of this is going to work.

Dad's kidney function was a concern today, so he'll probably be in the hospital until Thursday or Friday at this point.
