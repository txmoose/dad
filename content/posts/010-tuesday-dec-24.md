Merry Christmas Eve. 

Learned that dad should be discharged on Thursday to a SNF here in town. His kidney function is in question right now, but there isn't much that can be done to treat that. We had a scare tonight, too, while it was just me and him here in the hospital room. He was having trouble breathing. Nurse was *incredible* in caring for him and getting him comfortable. Resp therapist came and got him on a bipap (sp?) machine which got his SpO2 up, again, as well. He's comfortable again, enough so that he's getting some sleep.

I'm just praying for comfort for him from here on out.
