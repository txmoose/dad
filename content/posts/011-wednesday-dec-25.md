Dad and I had a hard night last night with him fighting the bipap mask and the struggles, but eventually got him settled. Unfortunately, his SpO2 crashed again today, and he had to go back onto the machine. I think he had some more moments of lucidity today, but its hard to tell anymore. 

We spoke with a social worker again today and got some clarity on going to a SNF vs to a hospice facility. Seems like we had a misunderstanding earlier on, but now it looks like Hospice is a better option. We have a meeting scheduled tomorrow, Thursday, to get more info on that, and, hopefully, dad will be discharged tomorrow or Friday to the hospice facility.
