Things moved quickly today. Moreso than even I anticipated. We met with a case worker from a hospice facility (company?) this morning, and it was actually very nice. She walked us through what Medicare will cover for us, what to expect with hospice, and such. She even took us over to the facility and showed us around. Dad was moved from the hospital to the hospice facility late this afternoon.

Honestly, this is, far and away, the best thing for dad. The facility is cozy, far more homey than the hospital was. His room is private, the facility has no more than 30 patients at any given time, and they really do give very compassionate care. The most meaningful part, though, is that the staff doctor at the hospice facility is the same doctor that treated mom for her cancer back in the late 2000s. She is a personal friend of mom's now, and when the case worker mentioned the doctor's name, mom burst into tears. When we toured the facility, we saw this doctor and had a wonderful chat. She is going to take amazing care of dad, and it really does feel orchestrated. 

It has been a long, long two weeks, but it feels like we're finally at a place where we can all breathe for a minute. We finally know what comes next, and we know what the state of things will be until that comes. The "when" is still a question, but I honestly believe it won't be a long time. Dad's kidney function was a concern at the hospital, and it was trending down the last couple days. We all know what is next. I think we're all processing it in our own ways. I personally have made some peace with it, but I know that will go out the window when the moment does come. 

I can not begin to express how much I appreciate the massive outpouring of support from mom's community, her church friends, our family, my friends, our friends... anyone who is reading this. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you, for all the support. You've all given me so much these last couple weeks, more than I can ever convey. Thank you.
