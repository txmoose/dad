We had some more restlessness issues with dad overnight. He pulled his central line out and pulled his oxygen cannulas out a number of times, as well. They've updated his meds here to some that should ease his breathing effort, as well as reduce his stress over some of the sensory "complaints" he's seemed to have had. 

Honestly, he looks like he's doing worse today than yesterday. Speaking takes increasingly more effort every day, and his breathing looks so much more labored. And I'm pretty sure he's put 2 and 2 together on where he is and where he'll be from here on. I just want him to be comfortable and at peace.
