The hospice switched dad from tramadol to morphine for his back pain. Honestly, it helps with his breathing now, too, and keeps him less anxious about the IV lines, nasal cannulas, etc... He's not doing well, anymore, and I'm sure it'll come soon, I'm glad he's being kept comfortable until then, though.

Emily brought dad's favorite cat up to the hospice house for him today. It was interesting watching the cat understand who he was almost immediately and be just calm and loving toward him. Dad had just gotten a dose of morphine, though, and I'm not really sure he knew the cat was there or what was happening. He did smile though.

We have to leave tomorrow. We have to get back home, and it is going to kill me to leave and say bye to him. These updates will probably slow down or outright stop unless I get info from mom and Emily and Caleb. Or I guess if they want to write updates here, too, I'll post them.

I love you, Dad. I'm proud of you. Its okay to rest now. I'll see you again one day.
